kibana_enabled: true
# Set to false to completely disable the role

# Installation{{{
kibana_major_version: 7
# The major version of kibana to install.

kibana_user: root
# The user that will own kibana files. Kibana itself will run as the kibana user
# as defined in the systemd service file that comes with the installation.

kibana_group: kibana
# The group that `kibana_user` will be added to. If the `kibana_user` is `root`,
# the `root` user will not be added to this group. By default, when installing
# kibana, the configuration files are owned by user `root` and group `kibana`.
# The default behavior of the role is to replicate this, while giving the option
# to the user to run kibana as an arbitrary user/group if the need to.
# }}}
# Configuration {{{
kibana_config: {}
# Use this array to set the kibana configuration. This will be merged with and
# overwrite a default configuration that ships with this role (`vars/main.yml`).
# The variables below will be used by the default configuration. Of course, you
# can ignore them and set the relevant keys directly in `kibana_config`.

kibana_name: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"

kibana_host: localhost
# The address where kibana will listen on.

kibana_port: 5601
# The port where kibana will listen on.

kibana_elastic_hosts:
  - "http{{ (kibana_elastic_certificates != None) | ternary('s', '') }}://localhost:9200"
# A list of urls where elasticsearch can be reached at.
# }}}
# Security {{{
kibana_elasticsearch_user: ~
# The elasticsearch user that kibana will use to connect to elasticsearch. Leave
# it `None`/`~` if there is no such user configured (ie if the default built-in
# user should be used without a password). Valid keys:
# kibana_elasticsearch_user:
#   name: UserName
#   password: UserPassword

kibana_elastic_certificates: ~
# Valid keys:
# kibana_elastic_certificates:
#   ca: path/to/elastic/ca
#   crt: path/to/kibana/cert
#   key: path/to/kibana/cert/key
# These files will be uploaded to `kibana_elastic_certificates_dir` and kibana
# will be configured to read them (if not overridden by you via
# `kibana_config`). The `ca` key show the path to the certificate of the CA that
# was used to sign the node's certificate. You can omit this key if you used
# a public CA to sign the certificate. The `crt` key is the path to the node
# certificate that will be used to verify Kibana against elasticsearch. The
# `key` key is the path to the private key used with the node certificate.

kibana_elastic_certificates_dir: /etc/kibana/certs
# The path where the `kibana_elastic_certificates` will be uploaded into.

kibana_elastic_certificates_passphrase: ~
# The passphrase used to encrypt the node's private key. If none, leave this
# setting to `None`/`~`.

kibana_update_passwords: false
# Set to true to update the `kibana_user.password` and
# `kibana_elastic_certificates_passphrase` in the kibana keystore. By default
# this is off to support idempotenty in ansible.
